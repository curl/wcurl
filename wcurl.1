.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwcurl\fP is a simple curl wrapper which lets you use curl to download files
without having to remember any parameters.

Simply call \fBwcurl\fP with a list of URLs you want to download and \fBwcurl\fP
picks sane defaults.

If you need anything more complex, you can provide any of curl\(aqs supported
parameters via the \fB\--curl\-options\fP option. Just beware that you likely
should be using curl directly if your use case is not covered.

By default, \fBwcurl\fP does:
.IP "* Percent-encode whitespaces in URLs;"
.IP "* Download multiple URLs in parallel"
.nf
if the installed curl's version is \>= 7.66.0 (--parallel);
.fi
.IP "* Follow redirects;"
.IP "* Automatically choose a filename as output;"
.IP "* Avoid overwriting files"
.nf
 if the installed curl's version is \>= 7.83.0 (--no-clobber);
.fi
.IP "* Perform retries;"
.IP "* Set the downloaded file timestamp"
.nf
to the value provided by the server, if available;
.fi
.IP "* Default to https"
.nf
if the URL does not contain any scheme;
.fi
.IP "* Disable curl's URL globbing parser"
.nf
so {} and [] characters in URLs are not treated specially;
.fi
.IP "* Percent-decode the resulting filename;"
.IP "* Use 'index.html' as the default filename"
.nf
if there is none in the URL.
.fi
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--curl-options, --curl-options=\<CURL_OPTIONS\>..."
Specify extra options to be passed when invoking curl. May be specified more
than once.
.IP "-o, -O, --output, --output=\<PATH\>"
Use the provided output path instead of getting it from the URL. If multiple
URLs are provided, resulting files share the same name with a number appended to
the end (curl >= 7.83.0). If this option is provided multiple times, only the
last value is considered.
.IP --no-decode-filename
Don\(aqt percent\-decode the output filename, even if the percent\-encoding in the
URL was done by \fBwcurl\fP, e.g.: The URL contained whitespaces.
.IP --dry-run
Do not actually execute curl, just print what would be invoked.
.IP "-V, \--version"
Print version information.
.IP "-h, \--help"
Print help message.
.SH CURL_OPTIONS
Any option supported by curl can be set here. This is not used by \fBwcurl\fP; it
is instead forwarded to the curl invocation.
.SH URL
URL to be downloaded. Anything that is not a parameter is considered
an URL. Whitespaces are percent\-encoded and the URL is passed to curl, which
then performs the parsing. May be specified more than once.
.SH EXAMPLES
Download a single file:

\fBwcurl example.com/filename.txt\fP

Download two files in parallel:

\fBwcurl example.com/filename1.txt example.com/filename2.txt\fP

Download a file passing the \fB\--progress\-bar\fP and \fB\--http2\fP flags to curl:

\fBwcurl \--curl\-options="\--progress\-bar \--http2" example.com/filename.txt\fP

Resume from an interrupted download (if more options are used, this needs to
be the last one in the list):

\fBwcurl \--curl\-options="\--continue\-at \-" example.com/filename.txt\fP
