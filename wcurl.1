- a simple wrapper around curl to easily download files.
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBwcurl [\-\-curl\-options \fI<CURL_OPTIONS>\fP]... [\-\-dry\-run] [\-\-] \fI<URL>\fP...\fR
\fBwcurl [\-\-curl\-options=\fI<CURL_OPTIONS>\fP]... [\-\-dry\-run] [\-\-] \fI<URL>\fP...\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwcurl\fR is a simple curl wrapper which lets you use curl to download files
without having to remember any parameters.
.PP
Simply call \fBwcurl\fR with a list of URLs you want to download and \fBwcurl\fR will pick
sane defaults.
.PP
If you need anything more complex, you can provide any of curl's supported
parameters via the \fB\-\-curl\-options\fR option. Just beware that you likely
should be using curl directly if your use case is not covered.
.PP
.TP
By default, \fBwcurl\fR will:
.br
\[bu]  Encode whitespaces in URLs;
.br
\[bu]  Download multiple URLs in parallel;
.br
\[bu]  Follow redirects;
.br
\[bu]  Automatically choose a filename as output, without overwitting files;
.br
\[bu]  Perform retries;
.br
\[bu]  Set the downloaded file timestamp to the value provided by the server, if available;
.br
\[bu]  Default to the protocol used as https if the URL doesn't contain any.
.br
\[bu]  Disable \fBcurl\fR's URL globbing parser so \fB{}\fR and \fB[]\fR characters in URLs are not treated specially.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-curl\-options, \-\-curl\-options=\fI<CURL_OPTIONS>\fR...\fR
Specify extra options to be passed when invoking curl. May be specified more than once.
.TP
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
Don't actually execute curl, just print what would be invoked.
.TP
\fB\-V, \-\-version\fR
Print version information.
.TP
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR
Print help message.
.SH CURL_OPTIONS
Any option supported by curl can be set here.
This is not used by \fBwcurl\fR; it's instead forwarded to the curl invocation.
.SH URL
Anything which is not a parameter will be considered an URL.
\fBwcurl\fR will encode whitespaces and pass that to curl, which will perform the
parsing of the URL.
.SH EXAMPLES
Download a single file:
.br
\fBwcurl example.com/filename.txt\fR
.PP
Download two files in parallel:
.br
\fBwcurl example.com/filename1.txt example.com/filename2.txt\fR
.PP
Download a file passing the \fI\-\-progress\-bar\fR and \fI\-\-http2\fR flags to curl:
.br
\fBwcurl \-\-curl\-options="\-\-progress\-bar \-\-http2" example.com/filename.txt\fR
.PP
Resume from an interrupted download (if more options are used, this needs to be the last one in the list):
.br
\fBwcurl \-\-curl\-options="\-\-continue-at \-" example.com/filename.txt\fR
